PB off RG on PB on RB on
This program involves three LEDâ€™s and a push button. The way the program 
works is when the push button is not pressed the red and green LED will be 
on. When the push button is pressed the green LED will turn off, the blue LED 
will turn on and the red LED will stay on. The goal of the program will be to 
use the if /if else commands as well as the digitaleRead/Write.
